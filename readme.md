ainv is a light-weight 1.12 addon to auto-invite players to parties and raids based on whispered keywords. Auto-converts a party when the 6th player attempts to join.

`/ainv help` - print all commands<br />
`/ainv set [keyword]` - set a new (case sensitive) keyword<br />
`/ainv toggle` - turn auto-invites on or off

ainv is as light-weight as possible. It has no UI and is entirely dormant until you set a keyword and open invites (at which point it only listens to incoming whispers). ainv does not save data in WTF either (which also means you need to set the keyword again after a relog or UI reload).
